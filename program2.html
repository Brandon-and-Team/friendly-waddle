<h1><center>What is it?</center></h1>

<p> 
Glaucoma is a condition the causes damage to the nerve at the back of the eye normally due to an increase in the pressure within the eye. There are numerous different kinds of the condition, but they all share the commonality of damage caused to the same region of the eye.
<ul>
<li>Primary Open angle Glaucoma- This is the most common form of the condition, it is very slow in its advancement and this is caused when the fluid in the front of the eye can’t drain away so as more and more fluid is created the pressure within the eye begins to increase.</li> <br>

<li>Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma- This is a less common form of the condition but much faster acting, the area where the fluid drains is cut off and so the amount of fluid rapidly increases leading to very swift damage at the back of the eye.</li> <br>

<li>Normal Tension Glaucoma- This is a rare form of the condition and is distinct from the other forms of glaucoma as with Normal Tension Glaucoma (NTG) The pressure within the eye will appear to be within normal ranges, but the damage is still occurring at the back of the eye. This could be because there is reduced blood pressure at the back of the eye which would result in normal pressure still causing the same damage. </li> <br>

<li>Secondary Glaucoma- This is Glaucoma that is caused by another condition this could be inflammation, tumours and even medicines such as steroids. This can develop over several weeks before it becomes a serious risk to the patient’s sight.</li> <br>
</ul>

<h3>Diagnosis</h3>

Glaucoma is more often than not detected during routine eye examinations as most patients will not be aware that they actually have the condition. The Optometrist will be able to diagnose someone with the condition with a couple of tests that will be described here.

<h3>Fundus Photos</h3>

A fundus photo is a picture of the back of the eye taken by the fundus camera. It will give the optician a view in to the back of the eye and from that he will be able to determine the overall health of the patient’s eye. This includes taking a close look at blood vessels, the retina and the general state at the back of the eye. In the case of Glaucoma, they will be looking at the nerve head in the eye to check for damages.

<h3>Tonometry</h3>

Tonometry is the name for taking the pressure readings within the eye, there are a couple of different ways we can take the pressure readings within the eye these include blowing a little puff of air into the eye, this is a test in which we take 3 or 4 readings to get a result. Another method is pressing a small

device onto the front of the eye and it will give a reading that way. The pressure reading is not a definite answer for a pressure reading as Normal tension glaucoma is not detectable by pressure.

<h3>Visual Fields</h3>

The visual field test checks a patient’s peripheral vision, this is used to detect any spots within the patient’s vision that the patient cannot see. Often patients will not notice any missing spots within their vision as the other eye will help to hide it, this means that this can normally only be checked within this test. In the case of Glaucoma patients will begin to lose areas of their vision at the very edges of their vision so this test will help to find that.
